## Klaveness Digital Case
- To run the application
```zsh
npm run start:fullstack
```

- to run the React Testing Library with Jest
```zsh
npm run test
```

- to run the Cypress on browser
- needs two terminals, one for the React app and one for the cypress
```zsh
npm run start:fullstack
```
```zsh
npm run test:cypress-open
```

### The application requirements (DONE)
- React or any other modern framework ii. Use a package manager iii. Apply some sort of code standardization tool iv. Fetch and update data using HTTP and parse it
- Present it in the UI vi. Look good, but donâ€™t spend too much time on the design.

### The questions you should prepare to answer (DONE)
- What is the general architecture of the solution? (How many components and how do they communicate?)
- Answer: With reusable components and Redux ToolKit
- Why did you select the libraries you selected?
- Answer: This is what we are using in our enterprise React applications
- How can you add any sort of type safety to the application?
- Answer: I am using TypeScript
- How did you proceed to test and verify the correctness of the solution?
- Answer: I am using React Testing Library v12 for integration tests and Cypress v8 for end-to-end tests
